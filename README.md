# INTRODUCTION 📢

[Configarr](https://github.com/raydak-labs/configarr) (created by [raydak-labs](https://github.com/raydak-labs)) is an open-source tool designed to simplify configuration and synchronization for Sonarr and Radarr (and other experimental). It integrates with TRaSH Guides to automate updates of custom formats, quality profiles, and other settings, while also supporting user-defined configurations. Configarr offers flexibility with deployment options like Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of Sonarr and Radarr. By streamlining media server management, it saves time, enhances consistency, and reduces manual intervention.

# SYNOPSIS 📖
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md) Configarr installation for your adventures on the high seas *arrrr*!

# MAIN TAGS 🏷️
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [1.20.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/configarr/tags?name=1.20.0)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is a bad habbit and should not be used at all. Many developers introduce **breaking changes** in new releases. This would messed up everything for people who use ```:latest```. If you don’t want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:1.20.0``` you can use ```:1``` or ```:1.20```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version. Which in theory should not introduce breaking changes.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!
